Fill a pool with water
Amigo, today our task is to fill the ship's pool.
Calculate how many liters of water are needed to fill the pool all the way up.
The pool is known to have linear dimensions a x b x c, given in meters.
These dimensions are passed to the getVolume method.
The method should return the number of liters of water needed to fill the pool.

Consider this example:
The getVolume method is called with the arguments 25, 5, and 2.

Example output:
250000


Requirements:
1.窶サhe getVolume(int, int, int) method must be public and static.
2.窶サhe getVolume(int, int, int) method must return a long.
3.窶サhe getVolume(int, int, int) method should not display anything.
4.窶サhe getVolume(int, int, int) method must return the correct amount of water, in liters, that is needed to fill the pool.
