Walking in circles
Create the Circle class with three constructors:
- centerX, centerY, radius
- centerX, centerY, radius, width
- centerX, centerY, radius, width, color


Requirements:
1.窶サhe Circle class must have int variables centerX, centerY, radius, width and color.
2.窶サhe class must have a constructor that takes centerX, centerY, and radius as arguments, and initializes the corresponding instance variables.
3.窶サhe class must have a constructor that takes centerX, centerY, radius, and width as arguments, and initializes the corresponding instance variables.
4.窶サhe class must have a constructor that takes centerX, centerY, radius, width, and color as arguments, and initializes the corresponding instance variables.
