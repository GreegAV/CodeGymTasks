/* 
Method quartet
Implement the 4 methods.
Each of them should return the list that is best suited for performing these operations
(i.e. the list that can most quickly perform a large number of operations).
You don't need to measure anything.


Requirements:
1. The program should not display text on the screen.
2. The Solution class must have only 5 methods.
3. The getListForGet method should return the list that is best suited for get operations.
4. The getListForSet method should return the list that is best suited for set operations.
5. The getListForAddOrInsert method should return the list that is best suited for adding or inserting elements.
6. The getListForRemove method should return the list that is best suited for deleting elements.
