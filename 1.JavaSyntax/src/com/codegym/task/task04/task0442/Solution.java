/* 
Adding
Use the keyboard to enter numbers.
If the user enters -1, display the sum of all entered numbers and end the program.
-1 should be included in the sum.

Hint: one of the solutions to this problem uses the following construct:

while (true) {
    int number = read the number;
    if (check whether the number is -1)
        break;
}

Requirements:
1.窶サhe program should read the numbers from the keyboard.
2.窶オf the user enters -1, the program should display the sum of all entered numbers and then end.
3.窶サhe program must calculate and display the sum of the entered numbers.
4.窶サhe program must use a for loop or a while loop.
